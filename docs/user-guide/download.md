# Obtaining DragonFly BSD assets

## Versions available

DragonFly BSD has two versions available:

- **RELEASE**: Typically this is the recommended version to run for
regular users. It is supposed to be stable and receives fixes when
needed, i.e. patches for security, stability and sometimes, although
less often, features.

- **Bleeding-edge**: This version receives all the ongoing development thus,
at times, it is less stable and can produce more crashes. This version is
recommended for developers.

## Type of content

Every mirror may have the following content:

- DPorts binary packages.
- Release ISOs and images.
- Snapshot ISO, images and kernels.
- Git source code repositories.

The complete list of mirrors is [here](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/mirrors/).
